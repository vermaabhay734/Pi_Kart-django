# Pi-Kart

Pi-Kart is a web application developed using Python, Django, and PostgreSQL, aimed at providing users with an e-commerce platform similar to traditional online shopping websites. It incorporates features such as user authentication, product management, order tracking, complaint filing, and feedback submission.

- **Complaints and Feedback**: Admin users can view and manage complaints and feedback submitted by customers.
- **Order Tracking**: Admin users can update the tracking status of orders to keep customers informed about their purchases.

### Client-Side Functionalities
- **User Cart**: Registered users can add products to their cart while browsing the website.
- **Order Placement**: Registered users can book their orders through the platform.
- **Order Tracking**: Users can track the status of their orders to know when they will receive their purchases.
- **Complaint Filing**: Users can file complaints if they encounter any issues with their orders or the platform.
- **Feedback Submission**: Users can provide feedback to improve the service and user experience.
- **Logout**: Users can securely logout from their accounts when they finish using the platform.
